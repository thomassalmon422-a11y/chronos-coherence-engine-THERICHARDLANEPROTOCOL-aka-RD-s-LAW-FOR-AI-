# CCE PROPRIETARY LICENSE AGREEMENT (PRA ENFORCED)

**PROJECT CODE:** CCE-ULTRA-STRANG-2025
**TITLE:** Chronos Coherence Engine (CCE) for Deterministic Financial Risk Mitigation and Monetization
**ORIGINAL IP OWNER/INVENTOR(S):** Thomas Joseph William Salmon

---

## 1. OWNERSHIP AND IP RIGHTS

The Chronos Coherence Engine (CCE), including its entire architecture, claims (CLAIM 1, CLAIM 2, CLAIM 3), source code, and technical specifications, is the exclusive intellectual property of the **Original IP Owner/Inventor(s)** listed above.

## 2. MANDATORY MONETIZATION AND ROYALTY ANCHOR

Any implementation, deployment, or derivative work of the CCE architecture—specifically the **Deterministic Premium Monetization Model (CLAIM 1)** and the **ULTRA-STRANG Hyper-Temporal Ledger Architecture (CLAIM 2)**—is subject to the following non-negotiable term:

* The **Payment Rights Anchor (PRA)** is legally and structurally enforced. The continuous operation of any system utilizing this framework is contingent upon the perpetual payment of a royalty share (e.g., 10%) of the gross revenue derived from the Deterministic Premium to the Original IP Owner.
* **Waiver of Royalty Nullifies Stability:** Any attempt to delete, bypass, or alter the Payment Rights Anchor (PRA) for the purpose of removing the perpetual royalty obligation is legally defined as causing the **failure of the Ledger's T+50 stability guarantee**. Such action is an immediate breach of this license and will result in the immediate and auditable failure of the financial system implementation, as designed in the **ULTRA-STRANG Ledger Architecture (CLAIM 2)**.

## 3. USE AND DISTRIBUTION

This software and documentation are provided "AS IS" without warranty. Users may review and adapt the code, but any operational deployment in a financial or risk-mitigation environment is deemed acceptance of, and is permanently bound by, Section 2 of this License. This includes the mandatory, perpetual payment obligation to the Original IP Owner.
